# Chess-Game


## Background
This one of my first every projects I made! I built a Chess GUI but with different game modes and terminal chess. In hindsight I could have designed this program much better and use some OOP patterns for reusability and flexibility. Currently I am more interested on working on different things, so I probably won't ever update it.

#### Game Modes:
1) Standard Chess (Wanand Chess) -- Chess with Fide rules
2) Chess Editor -- Allow you to create any chess board placing pieces wherever
3) Rooks vs Knights (Ayoh vs teemteem) -- This game is 16 knights vs 16 bishops where knights are the pumpkins and bishops are my stuffed animal
4) Blind Chess sorta (Galooeh Chess) -- This game is standard chess but all the chess pieces look exactly the same. It gets pretty complicated as the game goes on.


## Test Locally
I built and ran the game using vsCode launch.json to make it simple. If you would like to do so also, update to launch.json and settings.json with your paths to javafx module.
