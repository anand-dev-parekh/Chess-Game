# Chess-Game


## Background
This one of my first every projects I made! I built a Chess GUI but with different game modes and terminal chess. There are alot of flaws with this program such as the design of the Object Oriented Patterns I used that could be fixed. Currently I am more interested on working on different things, so I probably won't ever update it.

#### Game Modes:
1) Standard Chess (Wanand Chess) -- Chess with Fide rules
2) Chess Editor -- Allow you to create any chess board placing pieces wherever
3) Rooks vs Knights (Ayoh vs teemteem) -- This game is 16 knights vs 16 bishops where knights are the pumpkins and bishops are my stuffed animal
4) Blind Chess sorta (Galooeh Chess) -- This game is standard chess but all the chess pieces look exactly the same. It gets pretty complicated as the game goes on.
